This is not a program to use. This project was created in order to show my skills that I acquired for 1 year of university.
The idea of the program.
The program allows you to put objects in a warehouse and pick them up from there, interact with that objects. You can find staff by it vendor code.
The warehouse will have limited space soon. If the space is over, it will no longer be possible to put anything in it.
